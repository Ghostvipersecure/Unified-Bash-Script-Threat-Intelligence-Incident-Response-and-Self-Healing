This script is designed to integrate with Splunk and Threat Intelligence sources (such as MISP, OpenDXL, or commercial feeds). The script continuously fetches threat intelligence data, correlates it with internal logs, and takes automated remediation actions (e.g., blocking malicious IP addresses) while sending the details to Splunk for monitoring and incident tracking.

The script also supports self-healing by updating firewall rules based on new threat intelligence at regular intervals.
